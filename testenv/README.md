# AzEntLab

The template lab environment is now the [Azure Enterprise Lab](https://github.com/wpbrown/azentlab).

# Testimper

A testing tool with .NET Framework and .NET Core builds to test Kerberos S4U2Self impersonation. It has options to use WinHttp or the new SocketsHandler in .NET Core and to manipulate whether the TCB and Impersonation privileges are enabled. Example output [here](https://github.com/wpbrown/oakproxy/blob/master/testenv/testimper/output.log).

# Testasync

A .NET Core app for testing async and impersonation. It demonstrates that the impersonation context is being migrated to the thread by the Async execution context. Example output [here](https://github.com/wpbrown/oakproxy/blob/master/testenv/testasync/output.log).
